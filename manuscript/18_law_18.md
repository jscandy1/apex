# CHAPTER 18
## LAW 18: MOST PEOPLE ARE Non-Player Characters (NPCs)
*Stop Asking Them for Directions—They Don't Even Know What They're Doing*

---

## 📍 AVATAR STATE CHECK-IN

**BEFORE THIS CHAPTER:**
You ask everyone for advice. Your family, your friends, random people on the internet. You crowdsource your decisions like you're taking a poll. You think consensus equals correctness, so you seek validation before making moves. You let other people's comfort levels dictate your ambitions. When someone says "that's risky" or "I don't know if that's a good idea," you retreat. You've outsourced your decision-making to people who are exactly as stuck as you are, then wonder why you're not making progress. You treat advice from unsuccessful people with the same weight as wisdom from those who've actually done it.

**AFTER THIS CHAPTER:**
You'll understand that most people are running on autopilot. You'll learn to filter advice based on results, not proximity or volume. You'll master the art of selective counsel—seeking input only from those who've achieved what you're attempting. You'll stop letting NPCs navigate your life and start trusting your own judgment. You'll discover that the crowd is almost always wrong, and consensus is the enemy of excellence.

## 💎 VALUE STATEMENT

This law liberates you from the tyranny of mediocre opinions. When you stop asking directions from people who are lost, you stop getting lost yourself. When you seek counsel only from those who've walked the path, you compress your learning curve exponentially. The ROI is clarity—you'll make better decisions faster by filtering out noise from people who have no business advising you.

## 🧶 OPENING STORY: The Founder Who Listened to Everyone (and Failed)

Jessica launched her business based on advice from people who'd never launched anything. She had an idea: a subscription box for niche hobby supplies with a small market and passionate customers and a defensible niche. She started asking for feedback. Her parents said "That sounds risky, why don't you just get a stable job with benefits?" Her friends said "I don't know anyone who'd buy that, are you sure there's a market?" Random guy at a party said "Subscription boxes are oversaturated, you should do something else." Jessica absorbed all of it, started second-guessing, and thought maybe they were right, maybe she should pivot, maybe she should wait. Meanwhile her competitor with less experience but more conviction launched the same idea three months later. By the time Jessica finally launched after incorporating everyone's feedback and diluting her vision, her competitor had two thousand subscribers and brand recognition.

The lesson Jessica learned: her parents had never started a business, her friends weren't entrepreneurs, and random party guy was a mid-level manager at a dying company. **She'd asked directions from people who'd never been where she was trying to go.** One year later Jessica shut down her business while her competitor sold theirs for three million dollars. Jessica's autopsy: **"I let NPCs navigate my life."**

## 💡 CORE LESSON: THE NPC PHENOMENON

Here's the uncomfortable truth: **most people are non-player characters in the game of life.** They're running scripts: go to school, get a job, work for forty years, retire, die. They've never questioned the script, never deviated, never risked. **And they will give you advice as if they're experts.**

How to spot an NPC: they give advice outside their domain where they've never started a business but they'll tell you why your idea won't work, they've never been fit but they'll explain why your diet won't succeed, they've never traveled but they'll warn you about all the dangers. **Red flag: advice without results.** They default to fear with every suggestion being risk-averse like "that's too risky" and "what if you fail" and "you should play it safe." Why? Because their entire life is built on avoiding risk and they're projecting their fear onto you. They appeal to "normal" saying "nobody does it that way" and "that's not how things are done" and "you should be more realistic." **Translation: "I'm uncomfortable with your ambition because it highlights my lack of it."** They have no skin in the game where they're not invested in your outcome and face zero consequences if their advice destroys you, **but they'll still give it confidently.**

Not all advice is equal—here's how to filter. **Tier One is People Who've Done It:** they've achieved what you're attempting with scars and lessons and real-world data. Trust level: high, seek this advice actively. **Tier Two is People Attempting It:** they're in the arena taking the same risks and learning in real-time. Trust level: medium, good for commiseration and pattern-matching. **Tier Three is People Who Study It:** they've read about it and follow people who do it but they've never done it themselves. Trust level: low, interesting perspective but not actionable. **Tier Four is People Who've Never Thought About It:** they're commenting from pure speculation with opinions but zero basis. Trust level: zero, ignore completely. **The problem: most people ask Tier Three and Tier Four for advice, then wonder why they fail.**

Conventional wisdom says if most people agree it's probably right. **Reality: if most people agree, it's probably mediocre.** Why? Most people are average, average behavior produces average results, and if you do what everyone else does you'll get what everyone else gets. Example: most people say "Go to college, get a stable job, save for retirement," and most people also die with regrets and unfulfilled potential and minimal wealth. **Correlation? Yes.** The elite minority ignored the consensus, took calculated risks, built non-conventional paths, and got different outcomes. **The lesson: consensus is a lagging indicator of mediocrity.**

## 🌍 REAL-WORLD APPLICATION

In your career, the NPC approach has you asking your parents who worked one job for thirty years if you should quit to start a business, and asking your coworkers who are also stuck if you should negotiate for a raise. Result: you get advice rooted in fear and inexperience and you stay stuck. The apex approach has you seeking mentors who've built businesses and studying negotiation tactics from people who've ten-X'd their income. Result: you get advice rooted in experience and results and you make progress.

In relationships, the NPC approach has you asking single friends for relationship advice, asking divorced family members about marriage, and following relationship Instagram accounts run by people who've never had a lasting relationship. Result: terrible advice from people with no credibility. The apex approach has you seeking counsel from people in thriving long-term relationships and studying communication frameworks from couples who've navigated conflict successfully. Result: advice that actually works.

In personal development, the NPC approach has you asking out-of-shape friends for fitness advice, consulting broke people about money, and seeking wisdom from people as confused as you are. Result: the blind leading the blind. The apex approach has you hiring coaches who've achieved what you want and studying people who've mastered the domains you're entering. Result: compressed learning curve and faster results.

## 🛠️ IMPLEMENTATION BLUEPRINT

Run the advice audit for the next week by tracking every piece of advice you receive. For each ask: Who gave it? Have they done what they're advising me on? Do they have results I want? **You'll be shocked how much NPC advice you're accepting.**

Enter the no-advice zone for thirty days by implementing a rule: **"I will not ask for advice from anyone who hasn't achieved what I'm attempting."** This forces you to trust your own judgment, seek higher-quality counsel, and stop outsourcing decisions to unqualified people.

Apply the results-based filter where before asking someone for advice you ask yourself: **"Would I trade places with this person?"** If yes, listen. If no, politely ignore. **Simple. Ruthless. Effective.**

Build your advisory board by identifying three to five people who have achieved what you're working toward, are accessible through mentors or paid coaches or case studies, and operate with integrity. **Study them obsessively:** read their content, analyze their decisions, model their frameworks. These are your Tier One advisors and everyone else is noise.

Use the projection detector where when someone gives you advice rooted in fear you ask: **"Is this about me, or are they projecting their own limitations?"** Most "concern" is projection—they're not worried about you, they're uncomfortable with their own lack of action.

Practice the solo decision practice once per week by making a decision without consulting anyone: pick a restaurant, choose a project direction, make a purchase. **Build the muscle of trusting your own judgment.**

## 🎯 KEYS TO POWER

1. **Most people are NPCs.** They're running default scripts. Asking them for directions is asking the blind to navigate.

2. **Never take advice from someone you wouldn't trade places with.** If you don't want their life, don't take their advice.

3. **Consensus is mediocrity.** If most people agree, it's probably average. Excellence lives outside the consensus.

4. **Results are the only credential.** Don't care about degrees, titles, or confidence. Care about outcomes.

5. **Fear-based advice is projection.** When people tell you something is "too risky," they're revealing their own limitations, not yours.

6. **Seek counsel from those who've done it.** Tier One advisors have scars and lessons. Everyone else is speculating.

7. **Trust your own judgment.** You're not looking for permission. You're gathering data. The final call is always yours.

## 🌉 BRIDGE TO LAW 19

You've learned that nobody owes you anything, that everyone operates from self-interest, that victimhood is quicksand, that time is your most valuable asset, that confidence is built through evidence, that discipline beats motivation, that you are not your thoughts, that people are silently judging you, that charisma beats credentials, that boundaries earn respect, that integrity is non-negotiable, that scarcity breeds value, that silence protects execution, that boring consistency compounds, that overthinking is fear, that talent without work is wasted, that your comfort zone is a graveyard, and that most people are NPCs. You're filtering advice, trusting your judgment, making decisions based on results not opinions.

But there's one more trap waiting: **renting your life from distractions.** You scroll. You binge. You numb out. You tell yourself it's "relaxation," but really it's avoidance. You're not building a life—you're renting moments of escape from the life you're not building.

Law 19 will force you to confront what you're actually doing with your time. **Because Netflix won't pay your bills. And the life you want won't build itself while you're distracted.**

Turn the page.
