# CHAPTER 2
## LAW 2: MOST PEOPLE ARE SELFISH—USE THAT
*The Tactical Art of Aligned Incentives*

---

## 📍 AVATAR STATE CHECK-IN

**BEFORE THIS CHAPTER:**
You're disappointed. You keep giving, helping, and supporting others, expecting reciprocity. You think people should care about your goals, your projects, your success. When they don't, you feel betrayed. You label them as "fake" or "selfish" and retreat into bitterness. You're operating on the assumption that people should be as invested in your success as you are. Every time someone doesn't come through for you, it confirms your suspicion that people are terrible. You're caught in a cycle of expectation and disappointment, burning bridges and building walls.

**AFTER THIS CHAPTER:**
You'll understand that selfishness isn't a character flaw—it's human wiring. Everyone is running their own survival program, and you're a side character in their story. Once you accept this primal truth, you stop being disappointed and start being strategic. You'll learn to design win-win scenarios where helping you benefits them, turning human nature into your greatest advantage. You'll never waste another moment resenting people for doing exactly what they're programmed to do.

## 🧶 OPENING STORY: The Two Founders

Jake had the better product. Sarah had the better understanding of human nature. They both launched Software as a Service (SaaS) startups in the same month, both needed advisors, investors, and early customers. Twelve months later, Jake had shut down. Sarah had raised $2M and hit $50K monthly recurring revenue (MRR). Jake built a project management tool that was objectively superior—cleaner user interface (UI), better features, faster performance. He reached out to potential advisors asking for funding and advice, pitched investors to "believe in the vision," and told customers how passionate he was about solving their problem. He genuinely thought that if he built something great and asked for help, people would want to support him. His advisor response rate was 12%. His investor meetings ended in polite rejections. His customer conversion sat at 2%.

Sarah built a scheduling tool for coaches and consultants. It wasn't revolutionary, but it worked. More importantly, Sarah understood that nobody cares about her vision except her. When she reached out to potential advisors, she led with their interests: "I've been following your work on marketplace dynamics. I'm building a scheduling tool and I've noticed a pattern that contradicts conventional wisdom. I'd love 15 minutes to get your thoughts—and if this insight is useful, I'm happy to write it up and credit you." Her advisor response rate was 67%, and three became champions. When she pitched to investors, she showed unit economics and a clear path to profitability. When she sold to customers, she talked about their problem: "You're losing $10K/month to scheduling friction. This eliminates that in 14 days." Jake expected people to care about his success. Sarah made her success benefit them.

## 💡 CORE LESSON: THE SELFISHNESS PRINCIPLE

Here's the naked truth: everyone is selfish. Not in a mustache-twirling villain way. In a survival-wiring, evolutionary-biology way. Every human is running a program optimized for their own survival, comfort, status, and resource acquisition. This isn't cynical. It's mechanical.

Your boss isn't thinking about your career development. They're thinking about how your performance affects their performance review. Your friend isn't calculating how to support your business. They're managing their own stress, relationships, and goals. Your potential customer isn't excited about your solution. They're worried about their problem.

You've been told that good people are selfless and bad people are selfish. This is a comforting lie that sets you up for disappointment. Even apparent altruism is driven by self-interest. Charity donations bring status, tax benefits, and good feelings. Helping a friend move maintains the relationship and future reciprocity. Mentoring someone builds legacy and keeps skills sharp. None of this is bad. It's just honest.

When you understand that everyone operates from self-interest, you stop wasting energy on disappointment and start investing energy in strategy. Most people respond to selfishness in one of two ways: denial ("Not everyone is like that! There are good people!") which leaves them naive and frequently disappointed, or bitterness ("Everyone is selfish, so I'll just look out for myself and trust no one") which leaves them cynical, isolated, and ineffective.

The apex approach is neither. It's tactical acceptance. People are selfish. That's not a problem to fix—it's a pattern to leverage. Once you accept that everyone is optimizing for their own benefit, you can structure interactions so that helping you benefits them. This is the foundation of all persuasion, negotiation, and influence.

### The "What's In It For Me?" Filter

Before any interaction where you need something—buy-in, support, investment, cooperation—run this filter: "If I were them, why would I care?" Not "why should they care" (that's your perspective). Why would they care from their self-interested position?

If you can't answer that clearly, you don't have an offer. You have a request for charity. And charity is unreliable. It depends on people's mood, availability, and sense of obligation—all of which fluctuate wildly. But self-interest is consistent. People will reliably do what benefits them. So make benefiting you benefit them.

This isn't manipulation. Manipulation is getting people to do things against their interests through deception. This is alignment—finding the overlap between what you want and what they want, then making that overlap impossible to ignore.

### The Alignment Architecture

The most powerful people in the world aren't the most talented. They're not the hardest working. They're the ones who've mastered incentive alignment. They understand that you don't need to convince people when helping you clearly helps them. You don't need charisma when the math makes sense. You don't need authority when self-interest points in your direction.

Think about it: Why does your employer pay you? Because they're generous? No. Because the value you create exceeds what they pay you. Why do you show up to work? Because you're loyal? Maybe. But more fundamentally, because you need the money. Both parties are acting selfishly, and both parties benefit. That's alignment.

The same principle applies everywhere. Your customers buy because they value your solution more than their money. Your investors invest because they expect returns. Your mentor helps because it builds their legacy or sharpens their thinking. Your partner stays because the relationship meets their needs. Everyone is selfish. Successful people just design systems where everyone's selfishness points in the same direction.

### The Three Levels of Incentive Understanding

Most people operate at Level 1: they don't think about incentives at all. They just ask for what they want and hope people will help out of kindness. This works occasionally, usually with people who already like them or owe them something. But it's inconsistent and exhausting.

Smart people operate at Level 2: they understand surface incentives. They know their boss cares about results, their customers care about ROI, their partner cares about feeling appreciated. This is better. They frame requests in terms of visible benefits. But they're still limited because they're only seeing the obvious incentives.

Apex people operate at Level 3: they understand hidden incentives. They know that behind every stated want is an unstated need. Their boss wants results, yes, but they also want to look good to their boss, avoid risk, and maintain their status. Their customers want ROI, yes, but they also want to avoid the embarrassment of making a bad decision, the fear of change, and the social proof that validates their choice. Their partner wants appreciation, yes, but they also want security, excitement, and to feel like they're with someone valuable.

When you understand these hidden incentives, you can speak to them directly. You don't just pitch the results—you show how the results make your boss look brilliant to leadership. You don't just demonstrate ROI—you show social proof that removes the fear of being the first to try something new. You don't just show appreciation—you demonstrate that you're actively becoming more valuable over time.

## 🌍 REAL-WORLD APPLICATION

### In Your Career

Let's say you want a promotion. You've been working hard, delivering on your assignments, showing up consistently. The entitled approach is to think your manager should recognize this and reward you. You might say, "I've been here two years and I think I deserve a promotion." This assumes your manager cares about your tenure and your sense of deservingness. They don't.

The apex approach understands your manager doesn't care about your tenure. They care about their own performance metrics. So you ask: "What are the biggest problems keeping you from hitting your Q3 goals?" Then you solve one of those problems. When you ask for the promotion, you frame it as: "I've increased team velocity by 30% and reduced customer churn by 15%. Promoting me lets you scale this impact across the department."

See the difference? In the first version, you're asking them to do something for you. In the second version, you're offering to do more for them, and the promotion is simply the mechanism that enables it. You're making their self-interest (hitting goals, looking good to their boss) align with your self-interest (getting promoted). When interests align, resistance disappears.

### In Relationships

The entitled approach to relationships assumes your partner should know what you need. You shouldn't have to ask. If they loved you, they'd just do it. When they don't, you get resentful. This approach guarantees disappointment because you're expecting your partner to be psychic and selfless.

The apex approach understands that your partner can't read your mind and is managing their own needs, stressors, and priorities. Instead of expecting psychic selflessness, you communicate clearly: "I need X. It would make me feel Y. Can we make this happen?" And you reciprocate by understanding and meeting their needs.

This isn't transactional in a cold way. It's honest. You're both getting what you want because you're both clear about what you want. The irony is that this "selfish" approach creates better relationships than the "selfless" approach of suffering in silence and expecting them to figure it out. Why? Because when both people's needs are explicitly met, both people are happier. When one person martyrs themselves, resentment builds and the relationship dies slowly.

### In Business

The entitled approach to business is building a product and expecting customers to buy it because you worked hard on it. You think, "This is valuable! People should want this!" You talk about features, about your journey, about how much effort went into building it.

The apex approach understands customers don't care about your effort. They care about their problem. So you research their pain points, build something that solves a pressing issue, and communicate the value in terms of their outcome: "This saves you 10 hours per week and pays for itself in 30 days."

Notice you're not even talking about your product primarily. You're talking about their time, their money, their results. The product is just the mechanism. When customers see their self-interest clearly served, price becomes a detail, not an objection.

## 🛠️ IMPLEMENTATION BLUEPRINT

### Step 1: Audit Your Current Requests

Look at the last five times you asked someone for something—advice, help, support, a sale, buy-in. For each request, write down what you said and then answer honestly: Did I lead with what I wanted or what they'd gain? Did I make it easy for them to say yes? Did I understand their self-interest before I asked?

Most people discover they've been making charity requests, not strategic offers. They've been asking people to care about their problems, their goals, their needs. This works with your mom and maybe your best friend. It doesn't work with your boss, your customers, your investors, or most people you need things from.

### Step 2: Map Their Incentives

Before your next important ask, spend ten minutes mapping the other person's incentive structure. Write down: What do they care about most? Is it status, money, time, reducing risk, looking good to their boss, building their reputation, learning something new? What problems are they trying to solve right now? What would success look like from their perspective?

Write it down. Don't do this in your head. The act of writing forces you out of your own perspective and into theirs. You'll be surprised how often you realize you have no idea what the other person actually wants. That's why your requests fail. You're speaking a language they don't understand.

### Step 3: Redesign Your Ask as a Win-Win

Take your request and reframe it so it clearly benefits them. Instead of "Can you introduce me to your network?" try "I'm working on X and noticed three people in your network are dealing with this exact problem. If you think it'd be valuable to them, I'd love an introduction—happy to keep you in the loop on what we learn."

Instead of "Will you invest in my startup?" try "We're solving [problem] for [market]. Current unit economics show [metrics]. This fits your thesis on [area they're focused on]. Here's the specific opportunity."

Instead of "Can I get your feedback?" try "I'm working on X and hit an interesting challenge around Y. You've solved this before—would you have 10 minutes to share what worked for you? Happy to share what we implement and the results."

See the pattern? You're leading with their interest, their expertise, their potential gain. Your need is secondary to their benefit.

### Step 4: Build Reciprocity Before Asking

The elite strategy is to create value for people before you need anything from them. This isn't manipulation—it's pre-emptive alignment. Give first. Share useful insights. Make valuable introductions. Solve small problems for them. Amplify their work publicly. Do this without keeping score, without expecting immediate return.

When you eventually need something, they're not evaluating a cold request. They're reciprocating value already received. This is why networkers who "always take and never give" struggle, while people who lead with generosity build empires. The generous ones understand that you can't deposit goodwill after you need to make a withdrawal. You have to build the account first.

## 🎯 KEYS TO POWER

1. **Everyone operates from self-interest. Accept it.** This isn't cynical—it's mechanical. Stop expecting selflessness and start designing strategic alignment.

2. **Run the "What's In It For Me?" filter before every ask.** Map their incentives. If you can't clearly articulate why they'd care, redesign your approach.

3. **Lead with their benefit, not your need.** Frame every request in terms of what they gain, not what you want.

4. **Understand hidden incentives, not just surface wants.** Behind every stated goal is an unstated fear or desire. Speak to both.

5. **Make it easy to say yes.** Specific, small asks with clear value get more traction than vague requests for "help" or "advice."

6. **Build reciprocity preemptively.** Give value before you need anything. When you finally ask, you're cashing in social capital, not begging for charity.

7. **Alignment isn't manipulation.** You're not tricking people into acting against their interests. You're finding the overlap between your interests and theirs and making it impossible to ignore.

## 🌉 BRIDGE TO LAW 3

You've learned that nobody owes you anything and that everyone operates from self-interest. You're no longer waiting for fairness or expecting altruism. You're building strategic alignment. You're making helping you benefit them.

But here's the next trap that kills most people's momentum: the victim mindset.

Even when you understand the game intellectually, you can still get stuck in emotional quicksand—blaming circumstances, making excuses, and complaining instead of creating. You can accept that nobody owes you anything and still feel owed. You can understand that people are selfish and still resent them for it.

The victim mindset is psychological quicksand. The more you struggle against circumstances, the deeper you sink. And the brutal truth is that nobody is coming to pull you out. They're too busy managing their own lives. Which brings us to Law 3.

Because you can't dominate from a position of victimhood. Ever.

Turn the page.
